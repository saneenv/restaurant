api call in js
--------------

AJAX

-XMLhttp
-fetch
-asynch await

redirection in React
--------------------

react-router-dom
    -npm i react-router-dom


    import {
         BrowserRouter as router - all routing need component
         ,Routes                 - to set path for each component
         ,Route                  - more than one path
          } from 'react-router-dom';

useParams - hook used to access params from component url  

REDUX
------

coupling- many connectiomn between parent and child compomnent

props drilling(issue) - in coupling if any intermediate compomnent have any errors 
all other child will not work.

to avoid props drilling we need to reduce coupling and make all the components indepentent.

for this react introduced a new technology - state mamnagement technology - REDUX



redux process
--------------

create a new js file to keep the states, all the components can access the js file

- the components can access the datas from the js file 
but the cant update datas in js file 

-Action -> a file with all the logics to update the state
-Dispatch -> method used to dispatch the logic in action file when the compomnent 
             need state updation
Reducer -> update the datas in js file according to the payload response get
            action file      

libraries to apply redux
-------------------------

1. REDUX
2. REACT - REDUX
3. REDUX - THUNK

       npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk

createStore() - method in REDUX used to create store in js file 
              -2 ags
              -1- reducer 
              -2- middleware (used to make synchronous redux into asynchrnous)

applyMiddlware() - method in REDUX to apply middleware   

combineReducers() - method in REDUX used to combine all the reducers in js file


thunk -in REDUX-THUNK , used to create middleware 


1- create store
2- apply the store in index.js   
-provider  - its a tag used to pass the store (react-redux)


AXIONS - module used to make http methods (api call)

       - npm i axios 

useDispatch- hook used to dispatch actions in components - react-redux       



to access datas from store to components - useSelector -hook
